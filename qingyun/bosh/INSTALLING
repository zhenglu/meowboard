--- Bosh ---

Tihs is a imlementation of the BOSH protocol specified by XEP-0124.
It is not very compliant but it is a stable one.
Note that is is still in development and it is unstable, use it at your
own risk.
Suggestion, bug reports and contributions are all welcome.

--- Compilling bosh ---

To compile this code you need the following libraries:

- iksemel >= 1.2

You can edit the file makefile.config to set some flags passed
to the compiler if you need. Then just hit make.

--- Setting up the web server ---

You can use any web server, but I have tested this software with apache only
adn I'll explain how to set this up with apache.
All you need to do is to tell apache to forward a given address to a port that
the bosh will listen.

Say you want to redirect http://localhost/jabber to localhost:8082 you have to add
the following lines to apache.conf:

ProxyPass /jabber http://localhost:8082
ProxyPassReverse /jabber http://localhost:8082

You must enable the proxy module too, if it isn't already.

--- Setting up bosh ---

The only requirement is that you set the port that the
bosh must listen to by editing the config.xml.
The other options can be left unmodified.

Now we are done, just run the bosh.
