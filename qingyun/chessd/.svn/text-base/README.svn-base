--- Chessd ---

This is a implementation of a chess server, it was designed to replace the old
chessd. Hopefully the new one is more robust and more effcient.  Note that is is
still in development and it is unstable, use it at your own risk.

Suggestion, bug reports and contributions are all welcome.

For instructions on how to install see INSTALL

--- Compile ---

There are two ways to compile chessd, one is by traditional
./configure && make

the other way is to type 'make -f Makefile.2'
